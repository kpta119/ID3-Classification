# Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm. The classifier is designed to work with datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Structure
- [`ID3.py`](ID3.py): Contains the implementation of the Decision Tree classifier and related functions.

### Running the Classifier
To run the classifier, execute the [ID3.py](https://github.com/kpta119/ID3-Classification/blob/master/ID3.py) file:

```sh
python ID3.py
```
